Changelog
---------

desoot@0.1.0 Uses ElevationGrid; Random colours and elevations; uses both/config.js; gaps need filling
desoot@0.1.1 Filled gaps between ElevationGrid elements; Need to fix for non-square terrain-sections
desoot@0.1.2 Using `group` element, `def` and `use` attributes; Design looptopian, static mid-run; perlin texture with brightness/contrast; moody fog/lighting
